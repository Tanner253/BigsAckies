# BigsAckies - Next-Gen Rewrite: Project Handoff

**Project Goal:** Rebuild the BigsAckies e-commerce site from the ground up using a modern, performant, and visually stunning tech stack. The new site will feature a "deep space" theme, a superior UI/UX, and a more robust and maintainable architecture, while retaining all the functionality of the original.

**Current Status:** All core back-end and front-end functionality has been implemented. The application is fully functional, from user registration and login to product browsing, cart management, a complete Stripe checkout flow, and a full-featured admin dashboard. The primary remaining work is a final, comprehensive UI/UX design pass to meet the desired visual standard, as the current implementation has failed to do so.

**Tech Stack:**
*   **Framework:** Next.js (with App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (v3)
*   **UI Components:** shadcn/ui
*   **Animations:** Framer Motion
*   **Database ORM:** Prisma
*   **Authentication:** NextAuth.js

---

### Phase 1: Foundation & Project Setup (Complete)

*   [x] **1. Initialize Project:**
    *   A new Next.js project has been created in the `bigsackies-next` directory with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
*   [x] **2. Core Dependency Installation:**
    *   `shadcn/ui`, `framer-motion`, and all other necessary UI libraries are installed. The `tsparticles` library was attempted but caused persistent build issues and was removed.
*   [x] **3. Theming & Basic Layout:**
    *   A dark theme is configured in `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css`. A basic layout with a Header has been implemented.
*   [x] **4. Database & ORM Setup:**
    *   Prisma has been installed, initialized, and connected to the existing database. All models have been generated from the schema via introspection, and a singleton instance for the Prisma client is in place at `src/lib/db.ts`.

---

### Phase 2: User Authentication & Accounts (Complete)

*   [x] **5. Authentication Setup:**
    *   `next-auth` is fully configured with a Credentials provider for email/username and password login. The API route at `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` is functional.
*   [x] **6. UI for Authentication:**
    *   Functional `/login` and `/register` pages have been created with forms for user interaction.
*   [x] **7. Session Management:**
    *   The `Header` component dynamically displays the user's session status (name, logout button vs. login/register links). Session state is available throughout the application via `AuthProvider`.
*   [x] **8. Account Pages:**
    *   A protected account section is available at `/account`. A `/account/profile` page displays user info. The layout for Orders and Addresses pages exists but they have not been created.

---

### Phase 3: E-Commerce Core Functionality (Complete)

*   [x] **9. Product Display:**
    *   API routes for fetching all products and single products are functional. A `/products` page displays all items, and a dynamic `/products/[id]` page displays details for a single product.
*   [x] **10. Shopping Cart:**
    *   Full cart functionality is implemented. The "Add to Cart" button is functional, and the `/cart` page correctly displays items, quantities, and totals.
*   [x] **11. Checkout Flow:**
    *   A complete checkout flow using Stripe has been implemented. This includes creating a Payment Intent, securely collecting card details with Stripe Elements on the `/checkout` page, and handling post-payment redirection to a functional `/order-confirmation` page.

---

### Phase 4: Admin Dashboard (Complete)

*   [x] **12. Admin Foundation:**
    *   A separate layout for the admin section is in place at `/admin`. It is protected by role-based authorization, redirecting non-admin users.
*   [x] **13. Product Management (CRUD):**
    *   Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for products has been implemented in the admin dashboard.
*   [x] **14. Order Management:**
    *   A page for listing all orders and a detail page for viewing a single order (including items and customer info) have been implemented.
*   [x] **15. Customer & Category Management:**
    *   A page for listing all customers has been implemented. Category management is handled via the product creation/edit form.

---

### Phase 5: Finalization & Go-Live (Incomplete)

*   [ ] **16. Static Pages:**
    *   The main `Home` landing page is created. Other static pages like `About`, `Contact`, `FAQ`, etc., have not been created.
*   [ ] **17. Mobile Responsiveness:**
    *   A dedicated pass to ensure a polished and perfect mobile experience has not yet been performed.
*   [ ] **18. Final Testing:**
    *   While testing has been done throughout development, a final, comprehensive QA pass is still required.
*   [ ] **19. Deployment:**
    *   The application has not yet been deployed. The recommended target is Vercel.
*   [ ] **20. Handover:**
    *   This document serves as the project handover.

**Note for the next agent:** The core functionality is robust, but the UI/UX layer needs significant work to meet the client's vision of a "visually stunning" and "impressive" deep space theme. The primary focus should be on a complete redesign of the visual elements using the established "nebula" color palette. The current implementation has failed to satisfy the client's aesthetic requirements.
