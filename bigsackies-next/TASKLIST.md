# BigsAckies - Next-Gen Rewrite: Project Handoff

**Project Goal:** Rebuild the BigsAckies e-commerce site from the ground up using a modern, performant, and visually stunning tech stack. The new site will feature a "deep space" theme, a superior UI/UX, and a more robust and maintainable architecture, while retaining all the functionality of the original.

**Current Status (Revised):** The application's UI is well-developed with a consistent theme, but the core e-commerce functionality was found to have several critical bugs that have now been addressed. The application should now be considered functional, but requires a full testing pass.

---

**Tech Stack:**
*   **Framework:** Next.js (with App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (v3)
*   **UI Components:** shadcn/ui
*   **Animations:** Framer Motion
*   **Database ORM:** Prisma
*   **Authentication:** NextAuth.js

---

### Phase 1: Foundation & Project Setup (Complete)

*   [x] **1. Initialize Project:**
    *   A new Next.js project has been created in the `bigsackies-next` directory with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
*   [x] **2. Core Dependency Installation:**
    *   `shadcn/ui`, `framer-motion`, and all other necessary UI libraries are installed.
*   [x] **3. Theming & Basic Layout:**
    *   A dark theme is configured in `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css`. A basic layout with a Header has been implemented.
*   [x] **4. Database & ORM Setup:**
    *   Prisma has been installed, initialized, and connected to the existing database. All models have been generated from the schema via introspection, and a singleton instance for the Prisma client is in place at `src/lib/db.ts`.

---

### Phase 2: User Authentication & Accounts (Complete)

*   [x] **5. Authentication Setup:**
    *   `next-auth` is fully configured with a Credentials provider for email/username and password login. The API route at `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` is functional.
*   [x] **6. UI for Authentication:**
    *   Functional `/login` and `/register` pages have been created with forms for user interaction.
*   [x] **7. Session Management:**
    *   The `Header` component dynamically displays the user's session status (name, logout button vs. login/register links). Session state is available throughout the application via `AuthProvider`.
*   [x] **8. Account Pages:**
    *   A protected account section is available at `/account`. A `/account/profile` page displays user info. The layout for Orders and Addresses pages exists but they have not been created.

---

### Phase 3: E-Commerce Core Functionality (Complete)

*   [x] **9. Product Display:**
    *   API routes for fetching all products and single products are functional. A `/products` page displays all items, and a dynamic `/products/[id]` page displays details for a single product.
    *   **Note:** A bug was fixed on the `products/[id]` page that prevented it from rendering.
*   [x] **10. Shopping Cart:**
    *   Full cart functionality is implemented. The "Add to Cart" button is functional, and the `/cart` page correctly displays items, quantities, and totals.
    *   **Note:** A critical bug was fixed where the "Add to Cart" button was not connected to the backend API.
*   [x] **11. Checkout Flow:**
    *   A complete checkout flow using Stripe has been implemented. This includes creating a Payment Intent, securely collecting card details with Stripe Elements on the `/checkout` page, handling post-payment redirection to a functional `/order-confirmation` page, and saving the order to the database.
    *   **Note:** A critical bug was fixed where the application was not saving completed orders to the database.

---

### Phase 4: Admin Dashboard (Complete)

*   [x] **12. Admin Foundation:**
    *   A separate layout for the admin section is in place at `/admin`. It is protected by role-based authorization, redirecting non-admin users.
*   [x] **13. Product Management (CRUD):**
    *   Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for products has been implemented in the admin dashboard.
*   [x] **14. Order Management:**
    *   A page for listing all orders and a detail page for viewing a single order (including items and customer info) have been implemented.
*   [x] **15. Customer & Category Management:**
    *   A page for listing all customers has been implemented. Category management is handled via the product creation/edit form.

---

### Phase 5: Finalization & Go-Live (Incomplete)

*   [ ] **16. Static Pages:**
    *   The main `Home` landing page is created. Placeholder pages for `About`, `Contact`, `FAQ` have been created.
*   [ ] **17. Mobile Responsiveness:**
    *   A dedicated pass to ensure a polished and perfect mobile experience has not yet been performed.
*   [ ] **18. Final Testing:**
    *   While critical bugs have been fixed, a final, comprehensive QA pass is still required.
*   [ ] **19. Deployment:**
    *   The application has not yet been deployed. The recommended target is Vercel.
*   [ ] **20. Handover:**
    *   This document serves as the project handover.

---
**Note for the next agent:** The core functionality was found to be critically broken and has now been fixed. The UI/UX layer is well-developed, but the application requires a full QA pass before it can be considered ready for production. The primary focus should be on end-to-end testing of the e-commerce flow.

EDITED: the front end theme has been astablished, make sure to maintain it with new features that will be added. make sure to work closely with the user and the legacy website to ensure alignment with final product. be very careful and thurough and do not introduce duplicate code needlessly. please check for existing implementations before implementing new solutions.
