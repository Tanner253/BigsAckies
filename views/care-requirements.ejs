    <p class="text-lg">
      The Red Ackie Monitor, also known as the Spiny-tailed Monitor, is a small, intelligent, and active lizard native to Australia. They are a popular choice for reptile keepers due to their manageable size and inquisitive nature. This guide provides comprehensive care information to ensure your Ackie Monitor thrives in captivity.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Enclosure</h2>
    <p>
      A single adult Ackie Monitor requires a minimum enclosure size of 4 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. Bigger is always better, as these are active lizards that will utilize any extra space. A front-opening enclosure is recommended to reduce stress on the animal.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Substrate:</strong> A deep substrate of a sand/soil mix (60/40) is ideal. The substrate should be at least 12-18 inches deep to allow for natural burrowing behavior, which is crucial for maintaining humidity and providing a sense of security.</li>
      <li><strong>Hiding Spots:</strong> Provide multiple hiding spots, such as cork bark, logs, and caves. A "Retes Stack," which is a stack of layered wood or flat stones, is an excellent addition under the basking spot to provide a thermal gradient.</li>
      <li><strong>Climbing:</strong> Offer branches and ledges for climbing and enrichment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Heating and Lighting</h2>
    <p>
      Ackie Monitors require a hot basking spot to properly digest their food and maintain their health.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basking Spot:</strong> The basking surface temperature should reach 140-160째F (60-71째C). This can be achieved with a halogen flood light connected to a dimmer or thermostat.</li>
      <li><strong>Ambient Temperature:</strong> The cool side of the enclosure should be around 80-85째F (27-29째C), creating a proper thermal gradient.</li>
      <li><strong>UVB Lighting:</strong> A high-output UVB light, such as a T5 HO 10.0 or 12.0 tube, is essential. The UVB light should span the length of the enclosure and be replaced every 6-12 months, depending on the manufacturer's recommendations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Humidity and Water</h2>
    <p>
      While they come from arid regions, Ackie Monitors spend most of their time in humid burrows.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Humidity:</strong> The overall humidity in the enclosure should be around 60-70%. The substrate should be kept moist (but not waterlogged) by pouring water into the lower layers, keeping the surface dry.</li>
      <li><strong>Water:</strong> A large, sturdy water bowl with fresh, clean water should be available at all times.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Diet and Feeding</h2>
    <p>
      Ackie Monitors are primarily insectivores. A varied diet is key to their health.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Staple Insects:</strong> Crickets, Dubia roaches, and superworms are excellent staple foods.</li>
      <li><strong>Occasional Treats:</strong> Hornworms, silkworms, and the occasional pinky mouse (for adults) can be offered as treats.</li>
      <li><strong>Supplementation:</strong> Dust insects with a high-quality calcium powder with D3 at every feeding. A multivitamin supplement should be used once or twice a week.</li>
      <li><strong>Feeding Schedule:</strong> Hatchlings and juveniles should be fed daily, while adults can be fed 5-6 times a week.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Handling and Temperament</h2>
    <p>
      Ackie Monitors are known for their curious and often tameable nature. With consistent, gentle handling, they can become quite comfortable with their keepers. Avoid forced handling and instead allow the lizard to come to you. Tong-feeding is a great way to build trust.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Potential Health Issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD):</strong> Caused by a lack of calcium and UVB lighting. Ensure proper supplementation and lighting to prevent this.</li>
      <li><strong>Impaction:</strong> Can occur if the lizard ingests loose substrate. Using a proper sand/soil mix minimizes this risk.</li>
      <li><strong>Dehydration:</strong> Ensure proper humidity levels and a constant supply of fresh water.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-8">
      By providing the proper environment and care, your Red Ackie Monitor will live a long and healthy life.
